# Google Generative AI SDK for Kotlin Multiplatform ✨

<a href="https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:dev.shreyaspatil.generativeai"><img src="https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/dev.shreyaspatil.generativeai/generativeai-google?label=Maven%20Central&logo=kotlin&style=flat-square"/></a>

The Google Generative AI client SDK for Kotlin Multiplatform enables developers to use Google's 
state-of-the-art generative AI models (like Gemini) to build AI-powered features and applications. 
This SDK supports use cases like:
- Generate text from text-only input
- Generate text from text-and-images input (multimodal)
- Build multi-turn conversations (chat)

For example, with just a few lines of code, you can access Gemini's multimodal capabilities to 
generate text from text-and-image input:

```kotlin
val generativeModel = GenerativeModel(
    modelName = "gemini-pro-vision", // or "gemini-pro" for text-only input
    apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"
)

val cookieImageData: ByteArray = // ...
val inputContent = content {
  image(PlatformImage(cookieImageData))
  text("Does this look store-bought or homemade?")
}

val response = generativeModel.generateContent(inputContent)
print(response.text)
```

Supports the following Kotlin Multiplatform targets:
- [x] Android
- [x] iOS
- [x] JVM
- [x] JS
- [x] Wasm (_Use this [version](https://github.com/PatilShreyas/generative-ai-kmp/releases/tag/v0.1.2-0.0.1-wasm)_)

## Installation and usage

Add the following dependency to your Kotlin Multiplatform project for `commonMain`:

```kotlin
commonMain.dependencies {
    implementation("dev.shreyaspatil.generativeai:generativeai-google:<version>")
}
```

Check for latest version in the [releases](https://github.com/PatilShreyas/generative-ai-kmp/releases).

For detailed instructions, you can find a [quickstart](https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/android_quickstart) 
for the Google AI client SDK for Android (_Since this is a Fork of the original project by Google_).

This quickstart describes how to add your API key and the SDK's dependency to your app, 
initialize the model, and then call the API to access the model. It also describes some additional 
use cases and features, like streaming, counting tokens, and controlling responses.

## Try sample app

Try these apps built with this SDK by the community:

- [PatilShreyas/ChaKt](https://github.com/PatilShreyas/ChaKt-KMP): Chat-prompt based app for Android, iOS, Desktop, Web. Powered by this multiplatform SDK.
- [joreilly/GeminiKMP](https://github.com/joreilly/GeminiKMP): Kotlin Multiplatform sample that uses Gemini Generative AI APIs. Runs on Android, iOS, Desktop, WearOS and Wasm-based Compose for Web.

*(Have you built anything on top of this SDK? Let's add it here)*

## Documentation

You can use the APIs mentioned in the [API Reference](https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/android_quickstart)
by the official library.

From the official library, there are two major changes:
- Package `com.google` is mapped to `dev.shreyaspatil`.
- `Image(Bitmap)` was there for Android, instead `PlatformImage(ByteArray)` is used for KMP.
